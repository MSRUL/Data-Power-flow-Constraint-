# Data-Power-flow-Constraint-

Before start
1) The GUROBI, MATPOWER, yamilp is necessary before start.
2) The folder named "MAtlab_FUnc" is the sub-function library. The path of the folder and its sub-folder need to be added to the working path of MATLAB

Description:
1) Both the training and test case can be generated randomly in the "Main.m", by modifying the flag bit.
2) The randomly generated different training data and test data in the optimization results are different, but at the same level
3) The same training data and test data will  have different optimization results, because of the randomly generated basis vectors C in the dimension lifting function,but the difference is very small.


//The code will continue to be updated to improve the universality.
